# Bldrs.net

**The Builders Network**

_Connect with Developers, Brokers, Manufacturers, Suppliers, Designers, Contractors and Craftsmen._

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

**Bldrs.net is a Network of Businesses & Customers  to connect.**

_It's not a Social Network, It's a Business Network._

_Businesses aim to showcase their work, connect to other businesses and expand their business networks._

_Customers aim to have easy access to information about businesses and be better connected to all businesses in the eco-system to decide better decisions in their projects._

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Builders Sections & Businesses

Builders businesses are divided in three main eco-system sections.

All Business Entities can have a `BusinessForm` of ( `Company` or `Individual entity` ).

`RealEstate Section` :

- `Developers`      : { Buy / Rent / Sell / Develop } properties.
- `Brokers`         : { Buy / Rent / Sell } properties

`Construction Section` :

- `Designers`       : { Design / Engineer } properties.  
- `Contractors`     : { Manage } properties construction.
- `Craftsmen`       : { Construct } properties.

`Supplies Section`:

- `Manufacturers`   : { Manufacture / Distribute } construction products & Equipment.
- `Suppliers`       : { Sell / Rent } construction products & Equipment.

## Design Philosophy

**The Legacy of our Ancestors**

_Great constructs are the naturally occurring result of resourcefulness, strategic 
decision-making & persistence._ 

_Ancient Egyptians knew that, and developed accordingly inventing one of the first, 
and most sophisticated construction supply chains in history creating wonders, 
by simplifying singular tasks and combining collaborative efforts into one construct 
through the years._

**If they still exist in the information age, they would have built Bldrs.net.**

_**For the world to build together.**_

## Design Concepts

**1 - Bldrs.net is a directory of builders businesses**

- Any `business` that fits in Bldrs.net `Sections` and `BusinessTypes` can open a free 
  business account thus becomes a new `Bz` among many other `Bzz`.
  

- `bz` { creates / reads / updates / deletes } his data in Bldrs.net. 
  

- Any signed up `User` has full access to { read } all public data of `bzz` in Bldrs.net databases




**2 - Bldrs.net is an interactive space for Bzz data**

- `Bz` puts all basic data like { `bzLogo`, `bzName`, `bzCity`, `bzCountry`, 
  `bzFields`, `bzAbout`, `numberOfFollowers`, `bzAuthors`, `bzGallery` } in form of `FlyerHeader`
  Widget that expands to `maxHeader` widget and contracts to `miniHeader` widget showing all `bz`
  related info.


- `Bz` puts all his { work / services / products / ads / news } data in form of `Slide` Widget,
  each `Slide` is a simple page of `picture` & `title` combined with other `slides` in a group 
  of `slides` called `Flyer` that can be `viewed`, `shared` or `saved` by any user.
  

- `User` can `call`, `follow`, `unFollow`, any `bz`.


- `Bzz` `request`, `Approve` or `decline` `connectionRequests` from other `Bzz`.





**2 - Bldrs.net is City Based**
  
**3 - Bldrs.net has a multi-directional connection scheme**

- `Bzz` can `bond` their `flyers` together by `bondRequest` in specific `bondPoints` on any of 
  their `slides`, to allow any `user` to reach a `flyer` from another `bonded flyer`.


- `Bzz` can create a origin slide that can be used by other Bzz in their flyers


**4 - Bldrs.net is perfectly organized for user market research**


- `Flyers` are organized by `city`, `time`, `section`, `flyerType`, `keyWords`


- `User` may `search` Bldrs.net database for any given public info published by `Bzz`
