# Design Philosophy

**The Legacy of our Ancestors**

_Great constructs are the naturally occurring result of resourcefulness, strategic 
decision-making & persistence._ 

_Ancient Egyptians knew that, and developed accordingly inventing one of the first, 
and most sophisticated construction supply chains in history creating wonders, 
by simplifying singular tasks and combining collaborative efforts into one construct 
through the years._

**If they still exist in the information age, they would have built Bldrs.net.**

_**For the world to build together.**_

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Design Concepts

**1 - Bldrs.net is a directory of builders businesses**


- Any `business` that fits in Bldrs.net `Sections` and `BusinessTypes` can open a free 
  business account thus becomes a new `Bz` among many other `Bzz`.
  

- `bz` { creates / reads / updates / deletes } his data in Bldrs.net. 
  

- Any signed up `User` has full access to { read } all public data of `bzz` in Bldrs.net databases.


**2 - Bldrs.net is an interactive space for Bzz data**


- `Bz` puts all basic data like { `bzLogo`, `bzName`, `bzCity`, `bzCountry`, 
  `bzFields`, `bzAbout`, `numberOfFollowers`, `bzAuthors`, `bzGallery` } in form of `FlyerHeader`
  Widget that expands to `maxHeader` widget and contracts to `miniHeader` widget showing all `bz`
  related info.


- `Bz` puts all his { work / services / products / ads / news } data in form of `Slide` Widget,
  each `Slide` is a simple page of `picture` & `title` combined with other `slides` in a group 
  of `slides` called `Flyer` that can be `viewed`, `shared` or `saved` by any user.
  

- `User` swipes `slides` of `flyers`, goes to next `flyer`, finds related & suggested `flyers` by 
  simple taps & swipes.


- Bldrs.net pushes `Notifications` to users focused on relative & followed topics in App.


**3 - Bldrs.net is City Based**


- Each `bz` selects 1 city as its headquarters.
  

- All `flyers` are labelled by their `cities`.


- `Bz` can choose any other city for each flyer while editing in `flyer editor`, and a `flyer`
can only be in 1 city at a time.
  

- `User` can `view` any `published` `flyer` in the `city` that is currently browsing.


- Bldrs.net should be translated to `Languages` available in google.com with a simple tap.


**4 - Bldrs.net has a multi-directional connection scheme**


- `Bzz` `request` `Approve` or `decline` `connectionRequests` from other `Bzz`.


- `User` can `call`, `follow`, `unFollow`, any `bz`.


- `Bzz` can `bond` their `flyers` together by `bondRequest` in specific `bondPoints` on any of 
  their `slides`, to allow any `user` to reach a `flyer` from another `bonded flyer`.


- `Bzz` can create an `origin slide` that can be used by other `Bzz` in their `flyers`.


- `User` can ask a `question` to all `Bzz` of specific `BzType` with defined `Keywords` for
all of those `Bzz` to answer separately in private `chats`.
  

- `User` can label himself with simple `userLabels` { `looking for property`, 
  `want to sell/rent my property`, `planning construction`, `under construction` } to allow receiving 
  `targettedFlyers` from`Bzz` in specific `keywords` that he wishes to be more informed about.


- `Bzz` can `send a flyer to all` `users` of specific `userLabel` if `keyWords` are matching.


**5 - Bldrs.net data is perfectly organized for user market research**


- `Flyers` are organized & ordered by `city`, `time`, `section`, `flyerType`, `keyWords` & 
  `flyer score`.


- `User` may `search` Bldrs.net database for any given public info published by `Bzz`.


**6 - Bldrs.net profit methods**


- `Bz` `Free Account` provides a great digital marketing channel in this filtered focused local 
  market giving the `Bz` free `exposure`, `reach` & `footprint`.
  

- `Bz` paid `Pro Account` gives greater power of `exposure`, `reach`, & `footprint`.


- `Bz Challenges` reward `Bzz` with credit of `exposure`, `reach` & `footprint`, by directing `bz` to 
perform tasks in Bldrs.net to either { grow `numberOfUsers`, grow `numberOfSlides` or grow `userEngagement`
  rates }.
  

- `Pro Account` limited time offers for `Bzz` are key method for generating fast revenues.


- `Sponsor Account` is limited to specific `keywords` in a single `city` at a time, can only be obtained for a limited 
amount of time for high price, pushes `bz` `exposure`, `footprint`, `reach` & `flyer scores` to extreme
  unfair limits.
  

- `Ads` in between `flyers` smoothly appear and look slightly similar `slides` & `flyers`.


- `Payment` is done directly via App Store and Play Store payment methods in all `cities`, only
  developed for `Bzz` to purchase Bldr.net digital products.
  

- Bldrs.net does not provide any payment method between `Users` & `Bzz`.
  

**7 - Bldrs.net game rules**

_Dear `Bz`_

_this is not a social media, and our customers are usually short in time & budget, giving us limited screen time
with lots of flyers to showcase, use your slots mindfully publishing your best, and most strategic content._

_yours, Bldrs.net_


- `Exposure` is quantified by `screen time` duration.


- `FootPrint` is quantified by number of available `slides`/`flyers` slots in `bzGallery`'.


- `Reach` is quantified by the number of unique `users` in the `city` viewed any `flyer` of a `bz`.


- `flyer score` is quantified by several factors : `numberOfViews`, `numberOfShares`, `numberOfSaves`,
`flyerAge`, `keyWordIndex`, `bzAccountType`, `exposure`, `footprint` & `reach`.
