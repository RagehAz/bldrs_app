publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: BldrsHeadlineFont
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/bldrs_font_bold.ttf

    - family: BldrsBodyFont
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/bldrs_font_regular.ttf

    - family: EnglishHeadline
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/arabic/BldrsFont.ttf

    - family: EnglishBody
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/english/Roboto_Thin.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/english/Roboto_ThinItalic.ttf

    - family: ArabicHeadline
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/arabic/BldrsFont.ttf

    - family: ArabicBody
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/arabic/Tajawal_Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/arabic/Tajawal_Regular.ttf
