// what is exposure for Bz?
// more exposure  = more potential customers
//                = more footprint in users screens ( how many pixels occupied )
//                = more screen time in users screens ( how long pixels are occupied )
//                = reaching more users

// how do customers interact with flyer/Bz ?
// viewFlyer - saveFlyer - sendFlyer - bondFlyer - callBz - followBz - connectBz - receiveAnswers

// order previous actions by priority from POV of Bz
// callBz - receiveAnswers - sendFlyer -> bondFlyer - connectBz -> saveFlyer -> followBz -> viewFlyer
// calling bz means potential customer
// receiving Answers opens conversation with potential customer
// while sending flyer means free marketing with unknown number of recipients

// so how to get more interactions to a Bz
// by getting more exposure Quantity : more footprint + more screenTime + more reach
// by getting more exposure Quality : better position, mediaType (video instead of Image),

// so what are factors affecting Bz exposure/footprint/

// a count down of the first active 99 businesses
// first business takes 2.0
// second bz takes 1.99 then 1.98 ... 1.01
// to be used as early signUp multiplier

// possible flyers collections
