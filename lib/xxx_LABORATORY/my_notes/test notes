                                 Defaults to $FLUTTER_ROOT if set, otherwise uses the parent of the directory that the "flutter" script itself is in.

  Local build selection options (not normally required):
      --local-engine-src-path    Path to your engine src directory, if you are building Flutter locally.
                                 Defaults to $FLUTTER_ENGINE if set, otherwise defaults to the path given in your pubspec.yaml dependency_overrides for sky_engine, if any, or, failing
                                 that, tries to guess at the location based on the value of the --flutter-root option.
      --local-engine             Name of a build output within the engine out directory, if you are building Flutter locally.
                                 Use this to select a specific version of the engine if you have built multiple engine targets.
                                 This path is relative to --local-engine-src-path/out.

  Options for testing the "flutter" tool itself:
      --show-test-device         List the special 'flutter-tester' device in device listings. This headless device is used to
                                 test Flutter tooling.

    analyze           Analyze the project's Dart code.
